# Parallel-K-Means-Clustering-with-MPI
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm in both sequential and parallel forms using Python. The parallel implementation leverages MPI (Message Passing Interface) to distribute the workload across multiple processes, enabling efficient clustering of large datasets. The project includes a complete workflow from data loading and preprocessing to clustering and visualization.

Key Features:
Sequential K-Means Clustering: Implements the K-Means clustering algorithm to group data points into clusters based on their features.
Parallel K-Means Clustering: Utilizes MPI for parallel execution, distributing the clustering process across multiple processes to enhance performance and scalability.
Iris Dataset: Demonstrates the clustering algorithm using the popular Iris dataset, with visualizations for petal and sepal features.
Visualization: Provides scatter plots to visualize the clustering results and centroids.
Performance Measurement: Measures and compares the execution time of sequential and parallel implementations.
